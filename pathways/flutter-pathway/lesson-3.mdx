## The UI (Flutter)

If you have a look at CELO Composer you'll see that the starter code came with some UI boilerplate. Run your flutter project and you should be able to get the following UI.


### Directory Structure

- `.vscode` — VSCode settings including code snippets, recommended extensions etc.
- `android` — Contains all the Android-specific code.
- `ios` — Contains all the IOS-specific code.
- `lib` — Core modules, controllers, UI Code, constants, etc.
- `.gitignore` — A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `pubspec.yaml` — A pubspec is generated when you create a new Flutter project.

First, make sure that the following packages are all installed and to do so you can check your `pubspec.yaml` file

- [walletconnect_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/walletconnect_dart/example) : WalletConnect is an open-source protocol for connecting decentralised applications to mobile wallets with QR code scanning or deep linking. A user can interact securely with any Dapp from their mobile phone, making WalletConnect wallets a safer choice compared to desktop or browser extension wallets.

- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider/example) : A simple flutter package to manage state
- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http/example) : A composable, Future-based library for making HTTP requests.
- [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher/example) : A Flutter plugin for launching a URL.
- [jazzicon](https://pub.dev/packages/jazzicon/example) : This package contains how to make Idention. Identicon usually uses as an avatar of your wallet/crypto avatar. it is unique because generated by your address.
- [web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart/example) : A dart library that connects to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It connects to an Ethereum node to send transactions, interact with smart contracts, and much more!
- [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) : This package provides a concrete way of generating files using Dart code, outside of tools like pub
- [web3dart_builders](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart_builders) : This package is an extension of the web3dart package that includes the dart contract generator from ABI.

We will need the ABI of our deployed contracts and the address deployed, to make any call to our smart contract.
