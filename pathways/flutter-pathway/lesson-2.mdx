## Setup the Smart Contract

Okay, now that everything is set up, let's start with our smart contract.

### Design

For comments, we'll need a data structure that should contain the following information:

- An id
- The topic to which the comment belongs
- A message
- The creator
- A timestamp

We will also need the following few things for our UI (Flutter):

- A way to fetch a list of comments for a specific topic
- A way to add a new comment
- A way to receive updates about comments that have been added

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// ForumV1

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract ForumV1 {

  struct Comment {
      uint32 id;
      string topic;
      address creator_address;
      string message;
      uint created_at;
  }

  uint32 private idCounter;

  mapping(string => Comment[]) private commentsByTopic;

  event CommentAdded(Comment comment);

  function getComments(string calldata topic) public view returns(Comment[] memory) {

      return commentsByTopic[topic];

  }


  function addComment(string calldata topic, string calldata message) public {

      Comment memory comment = Comment({
          id: idCounter,
          topic: topic,
          creator_address: msg.sender,
          message: message,
          created_at: block.timestamp
      });

      commentsByTopic[topic].push(comment);

      idCounter++;

      emit CommentAdded(comment);
  }
}
```

The ForumV1 Contract has two functions

- addComment: allows you to create a new comment; it stores the created comments using topic in the commentsByTopic mapping
- getComments: a method to access all comments by topic

### Deploy Smart contract

- Open your Hardhat project folder (packages/hardhat)

- Copy the .envexample to a new file called .env. This is where the private key you use to deploy your contracts will be saved.

- Fill in the private key with your Celo wallet private key. You might want to get some Alfajores (Testnet) coins from the Celo Faucet

- Open your Contracts folder (packages/hardhat/contracts)

- Add a new contract in the folder called ForumV1.sol and paste the above contract into the contract file.

Your hardhat project was set up with the hardhat-deploy plugin which makes deployments very easy.

To deploy, go to the deploy folder, open the 00-deploy.js file, and you will see an example deployment function for the existing Greeter contract.

Add the following code to the 00-deploy.js file

```js showLineNumbers
await deploy(“ForumV1”, {
  from: deployer,
  args: [],
  log: true,
})
```

Then update the module.exports tags to include ForumV1 Contract like below.

```js
module.exports.tags = [..., "ForumV1];
```

Deploy the Contracts by running the following commands on any terminal (make sure you are in the packages/hardhat directory)

```bash
npx hardhat deploy –network alfajores
```

If all is well, you should see a message from hardhat with the transaction hash of your Contract deployment and the address of your new Contract

You can now view your contract on the CELO explorer (Alfajores) using the address.

Now that we have deployed our contract let’s build the dApp.
